# Lead claims

Claim record for the three dev leads. Priya is the only writer. Leads read it from `origin/develop_staging` with `git show`, never from their own branch. Rules: `.claude/docs/multi-lead.md`.

## Claims

| Lead | Ticket | Branch | Files and folders claimed | Legal paths | Since |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| shashank | T-277 | fix/t-277-bns-offences-table | apps/drafting/src/config/bns-offences.json (replace byte for byte with Ajay's signed file: handoff/legal/T-277-bns-offences-corrected-signed.md, 29f4872, SHA-256 in that file); apps/drafting/src/services/timeline.service.ts (null max_years); apps/drafting/src/services/bail-check.service.ts (null bailable/cognizable, parent-row resolution); their tests; also (extended by Priya 12 Oct, option a: the table plus everything that reads it): apps/drafting/src/config/bns-bailability.json (the stale copy injected into drafting prompts as 'use EXACTLY as given': retire it and generate from bns-offences.json; Ajay signs the result), apps/drafting/src/services/template-engine.service.ts (classifySectionsBailability, BNS_VALID_SECTIONS), sections.service.ts (null compoundable and null max_years must not become 'no' or 'Magistrate'; sub-section lookup), preflight.service.ts and validator.ts ('103(1)' resolves to its parent, never blocked), the routes and tests for these; apps/drafting/src/config/bns-mapping.json (only the two unused title copies bns_offences "141" and "318", Ajay's item 6; added by Priya 12 Oct); posh_complaint.json:438, fir_quashing.json:327 and golden fixtures 15/16/18 only with Ajay's signed lines; and a grep of the packs and prompts for BNS bailability or offence titles outside the table (ask me before changing any other file; list moved tests and snapshots for Ajay); also (Priya, 12 Oct): apps/drafting/src/services/bns-offence-resolver.ts (new), apps/drafting/src/__tests__/t267-ipc-bns-table.test.ts, and minimal null guards only in apps/web timeline-tracker/page.tsx and bail-checker/page.tsx (show the API's Ajay text, no layout change; T-278 web part follows) | yes: bns-offences.json is Ajay's signed table; the bail-check and timeline diffs go to him before merge | go given by the founder, 12 Oct 2026 |
| mahak | T-115e | fix/t-115e-no-matter-label | apps/drafting/src/services/intake.service.ts (stop writing Event.metadata.label; category only), a one-line unset script under apps/drafting/src/scripts/, their tests; grep for other places a matter label or description reaches events, logs or analytics and list them to Priya before changing anything outside this row. Ajay's ruling in the T-115e ticket | no | 12 Oct 2026 |
| vishal | T-266 | fix/t-266-cue-word-start | apps/drafting/src/services/brief-drafter.ts (cue matching only: word-start match for Latin cues, whole-token FIR number), new t266-*.test.ts. Ajay's rule in the T-266 ticket; he signs the diff, moved snapshots go to him. Not touched: ai.service.ts, the packs | yes: brief-drafter.ts cue matching is Ajay's rule | 12 Oct 2026 |

## Next per lead (Priya, 11 Oct 2026). Not claims: each is assigned only when its row is free and its gate is met

| Lead | Next, in order | Gate still open |
|---|---|---|
| vishal | 1. T-237 (earlier applications in the other bail packs; uses his T-200 cue map) 2. T-241 (bail instructions assert facts; same packs, after T-237) 2b. T-245a (old/new law switch, bail packs; Ajay signed 345bd24; builds on mahak's T-251 for default_bail) 2h. T-270 (validateBnsSections misses code-first cites; after T-200; Ajay's rule first) 2i. T-269 (drafting build hides tsc errors; HIGH, tiny, any lead who is free) 2g. T-267 (IPC→BNS table recheck; after T-250 + T-255; Ajay signs the table first) 2e. T-263 (citation-check keeps case names starting with an initial; HIGH priority, Ajay's rule first) 2f. T-266 (cue matching: word start and whole-token FIR number; after T-200) 2d. T-261 (clause repair after check 3; Ajay's rule first) 3. T-231 (section-aware matching) | T-237: met (Ajay signed, handoff/legal/T-237-pack-text-signed.md, 909a49c). T-241: Ajay's text. T-231: Ajay's matching rule |
| mahak | 0. T-268 (terms page, Ajay's nine signed edits; after T-234) 1. T-233 (empty DOCX, PDF margin; same file as T-194) 2. T-190 + T-199 on one branch (bail_regular.json questions; moved from vishal, 12 Oct) 3. T-226 (no overspend) | T-233: none. T-190/T-199: met (Ajay signed both, Arjun confirmed the gate). T-226: Arjun's mechanism (asked 12 Oct) |
| shashank | 00. T-267 (IPC→BNS corrected table, Ajay signed 4fed16e, 12 Oct; replace ipc-to-bns.json byte for byte, same drill as T-250/T-255; also apps/drafting/src/scripts/seed-sections.ts: add 'IPC' to SIGNED_TABLES so IPC rows carry Ajay's validatedBy; right after T-250+T-255 merges) 0. T-240 (category list in code; same files and pattern as T-227, small; needed before T-239 batch 1 builds) 1. T-234 (email and password sign-up in the web app + terms acceptance record; moved in for v1, 12 Oct) 2. T-221 (forgot password; same login page) 3. T-229 (Sentry scrub, needs packages/shared) | T-234: met (Rajesh's check, Ajay's consent line). T-221: met (design, copy approved); sends for real only after T-220. T-229: none |
| kunal | T-274 | fix/t-274-editor-escape | apps/web/src/components/editor/DocumentEditor.tsx (textToHtml escaping only), its tests. Small-fix mode. Not touched: drafting, other web files | no | 12 Oct 2026 |
| tanvi | T-281 | fix/t-281-converter-mobile-overflow | apps/web/src/app/tools/section-converter/page.tsx (layout at 375 px only; no wording or data change). Small-fix mode. Not touched: drafting, other web pages | no | 12 Oct 2026 |
| unassigned (template builds, after T-240 merges; assign by who is free) | T-258, T-259, T-260 (batch 1 civil, family/consumer, notices/deeds; need T-240 only), T-257 (batch 1 criminal; also needs T-245a), T-265 (batch 2 criminal, first 11; after T-257 and T-255) |  |
| unassigned | T-191, T-192 (Ajay signs the logic), T-223 (criteria to write), T-232 (Arjun triage), T-235 (Ajay text), T-129, T-193, T-198, T-188, T-207 | As listed |

## Ready to build, no gate (Priya, 12 Oct 2026)

- T-226 (no overspend; mahak is next after T-279 (asked 12 Oct); Arjun's `inkHolds` design is in the ticket, T-197 merged): next for the first lead who is free; builds before T-115 (both edit `documents.routes.ts`).
- T-220 (emails): the AC6 log leak in `ses.ts` is fixed first; then one founder session for SES and DNS is the remaining gate (morning report).
- T-115: after T-226. Gates: Atlas tier and prod migration (founder), 30-day wording (Ajay), screens (Rajesh).

- T-283 (env default for the two switches; small, drafting only, scoped by Arjun): next for vishal after T-263.
- T-253a+c (assistant): after T-226 and the v1 blockers (Priya's call, 12 Oct). Overlaps: documents.routes.ts (T-226, then T-115a); drafting config/env.ts and app.ts (T-253a, T-283); web layout.tsx and Sidebar.tsx (T-253d, T-234, T-281).

- T-285 (SSE keep-alive on the four drafting streams; small, drafting only; touches ai.service.ts, so after T-241 and T-245a or when no lead holds it): ready.

## Merge queue
